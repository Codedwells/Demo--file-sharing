# File-sharing App

## For starting Backend
cd File - backend <br />
npm i <br />
npm run rev <br />

## For starting Frontend
cd file-store <br />
npm i <br />
npm start <br />

## Description.
Start the backend and frontend then upload a file with the user's name. The file should then be updated in the table below. When you hover over the file name and click it, it will open in a new window tab. We can open the files on every system, where the instance is open. <br />
We can access the files from any system where the instance is running. We couldn't host it on any server because of the time constraint, so we had to run it locally. We can access the files from multiple devices if we deploy this app.
